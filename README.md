# Autonomous_Vehicles_Specialization
Projects while studying the Autonomous Vehicles special course by University of Toronto

## Course 1 : Introduction
* kinematic, dynamic modeling of the autonomous vehicle model
* system modeling of the environment: rule-based, real-time
* hw and sw architecture of the autonomous vehicle
* longitudinal, lateral control

## Course 2: Localization
* state estimation using Least Squares method and KalmanFilter Algorithm
* sample question for extended KF algorithm
* state estimation and path finding using ErrorState-ExtendedKalmanFilter(ESEKF) Algorithm with SensorFusion (LiDAR, GNSS, IMU) + Visualization

## Course 3: Perception
* 3D Camera Perception via geometry and disparity algorithm
* Odometry, Depth estimation
* Object Detection
* Semantic Segmentation
